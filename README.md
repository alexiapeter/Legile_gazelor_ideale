# Ideal Gas Laws - Graphs - (Legile_gazelor_ideale)
Ideal Gas Laws Simulation Program - In colaboration with Peter Amalia (Technological Physics student)

  This project is a thermodynamics simulation program that analyzes the transformations of an ideal gas within a closed system. The user inputs the degree of freedom for the gas (3 for monoatomic gases, 5 for diatomic gases) and the number of moles involved. The system, modeled as a frictionless piston-cylinder setup, undergoes three types of thermodynamic transformations: isobaric, isochoric, and isothermal.

The program calculates:

The molar heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume.
The work done, heat exchange, and change in internal energy for each transformation.
The total heat transferred (absorbed or released) during the process.
Additionally, the program provides a graphical representation of the transformations on a Pressure-Volume (P-V) coordinate system, allowing users to visualize the thermodynamic processes.

Input Parameters:
Pressure: Between 0-450 × 10³ N/m².
Volume: Between 0-600 m³.
Temperature: Between 274.15-500 K.
The project serves as an educational tool for understanding the fundamental laws governing ideal gas behavior and is useful for students and professionals studying thermodynamics. 

3 transformations : isobaric, isochoric, isothermal.
